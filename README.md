# Google Books Search

## My Repository

In this repository, you will find my Google Books Search application created using React.js in the front-end and MongoDB in the back-end. The purpose of this application is to allow users to search for films and save them to their collection.

## Installation

This application does not need to be installed, as it can be viewed live on Heroku at the following URL: [https://bjp-book-search.herokuapp.com/search](https://bjp-book-search.herokuapp.com/search)

## Software Used

The development of this project was completed using Visual Studio Code. I used React.js in the front-end with the Semantic UI CSS Framework for styling. For the back-end, I used Node.js with MongoDB and Express.js, with help from the Google Books API and Socket.io for notifications.

## Conclusion

This application was a great way to consolidate everything I've learned about web development and I'm really happy with the final product. This was probably the most challenging application I have developed thus far, but also the most rewarding to complete.
